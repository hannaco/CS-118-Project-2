# CS118 Project 2

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Provided Files

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` are the entry points for the server and client part of the project.

## Academic Integrity Note

At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Wireshark dissector

For debugging purposes, you can use the wireshark dissector from `tcp.lua`. The dissector requires
at least version 1.12.6 of Wireshark with LUA support enabled.

To enable the dissector for Wireshark session, use `-X` command line option, specifying the full
path to the `tcp.lua` script:

    wireshark -X lua_script:./confundo.lua

To dissect tcpdump-recorded file, you can use `-r <pcapfile>` option. For example:

    wireshark -X lua_script:./confundo.lua -r confundo.pcap
